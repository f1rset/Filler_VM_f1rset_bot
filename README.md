**Bot uses three algorithms:**
1) On the smallest map it is just moving toward the opponent.
2) On the middle sized map it firstly draws a diagonal and than moves toward the opponent.
3) On huge map it has a bit harder algorithm, because it makes two lines to give lesser space for opponent and than moves towards it.
